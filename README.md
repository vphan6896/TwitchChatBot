Made this for fun and creating a base template for a chatbot. Code should be self-explanatory.
Used this app https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to generate an oauth token.
Future plan is to add more interesting commands such as a voting poll that the streamer can configure to their liking
but that would require using a database and reading a large volume of messages. Interesting problem, but
this project is good for now.
